# udacity_weather_affects_restaurant_ratings

Welcome to the project "Designing a Data Warehouse for Reporting and OLAP." In this project, I explored the relationship between weather and customer reviews of restaurants using real-world Yelp and climate datasets. The project revolves around architecting and designing a Data Warehouse (DWH) for the purpose of reporting and online analytical processing (OLAP). I utilized Snowflake, a cloud-native data warehouse system, to accomplish this task.
